            Montjuïc translates to "Jewish Mountain" from medieval Latin and Catalan, and remains of a medieval Jewish cemetery have been found there. Montjuïc, because of its strategic location at the foot of the Mediterranean, and alongside an important river communication channel such as the Llobregat River, was the birthplace of the city of Barcelona. Montjuïc served as a prison and execution ground for both sides of the conflict, in the Spanish civil war.  One of the best viewpoints is from the rooftop of the National Museum of Catalan Art. You will be able to capture a whole new Barcelona. There is an outdoor bar at the top of the hill. At the top of the mountain, you will be able to spot a bar named La Caseta del Migdia.
